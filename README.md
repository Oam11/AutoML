# AutoML with Langchain

Welcome to **AutoML with Langchain**! This web application is designed to simplify and automate your data analysis and machine learning workflows. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or just getting started, this tool provides an intuitive interface for exploring and modeling your data.

## Features

### 1. Upload Your Dataset
- **Upload CSV Files**: Easily upload your dataset in CSV format.
- **Encoding Detection**: Automatically handles various file encodings to ensure smooth data loading.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Detailed Profiling**: Generate a comprehensive data profile report using YData Profiling.
- **Download Reports**: Save the EDA report as an HTML file for offline analysis.

### 3. Machine Learning
- **Target Selection**: Choose the target variable for your machine learning model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Apply TF-IDF or PCA to enhance your data.
- **Model Training**: Automatically set up and compare various machine learning models.
- **Save and Download**: Save the best model and download it for future use.

### 4. Ask Questions
- **Natural Language Queries**: Use Langchain with Groq to ask questions about your data.
- **AI-Powered Answers**: Get detailed responses to understand your data better.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `ydata_profiling`
- `streamlit_ydata_profiling`
- `pycaret`
- `scikit-learn`
- `langchain`
- `langchain_experimental`
- `langchain_groq`
- `pdfkit`
- `tabulate` (optional, required for some functionalities)

Install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas ydata_profiling streamlit_ydata_profiling pycaret scikit-learn langchain langchain_experimental langchain_groq pdfkit tabulate
```

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automl-langchain.git
   cd automl-langchain
   ```

2. Set up the environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your API keys in `secrets.toml`:

   ```toml
   [groq]
   api_key = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Navigate Through the Application**:
   - **Upload Your Dataset**: Upload your CSV file and view the data.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze your data and download the profile report.
   - **Machine Learning**: Select your target variable, apply preprocessing, and train machine learning models.
   - **Ask Questions**: Input questions about your data and receive answers using AI.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
- **API Initialization Errors**: Check your API key and configuration. Make sure `secrets.toml` is correctly set up.
